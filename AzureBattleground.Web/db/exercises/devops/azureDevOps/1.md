## Introduction
When building Docker images using CI solutions like Azure DevOps, it's important to test your application in the same environment, it'll be working when deployed. This implies running tests inside a container, what requires some neat tricks to get working. In this exercise, you'll learn how to run them inside an Azure DevOps pipelines and push to Azure Container Registry.
## Requirements
To perform this exercise, you'll need:
* Dockerfile you want to build
* access to Azure DevOps project
* an empty Azure Pipeline
* a .NET application with tests
## Getting started
To get started, we'll have to correctly structure our Dockerfile. This step is required to be able to divide our build process into two steps:
* application build + tests
* application publish

This can described as follows:
```
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/aspnet:2.2-alpine3.9 AS runtime
WORKDIR /app
EXPOSE 80
EXPOSE 443

FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk:2.2-alpine3.9 AS build
WORKDIR /src
COPY *.sln .
COPY MyApp/. ./MyApp/
COPY MyApp.Tests/. ./MyApp.Tests/

RUN dotnet test "./MyApp.Tests/MyApp.Tests.csproj" --logger "trx;LogFileName=MyApp.Tests.trx" 

FROM build AS publish
RUN dotnet publish -c Release -o out

FROM runtime AS final
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=publish /src/MyApp/out .
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "MyApp.dll"]
```
As you can, I divided my Dockefile into three separate stages. This will be crucial to ensure, that we're able to publish tests results.
